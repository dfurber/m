M

M is a framework for a framework. If you like Drupal but hate building custom stuff in it, and love Rails for custom stuff but hate building out the tedious stuff that you can just install modules for, then M may be for you.

It is still under active development and not even ready for alpha use. Just pushed out to reserve the M name.
